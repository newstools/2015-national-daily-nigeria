Popular carbonated drink maker, La Casera Company Plc is heading for trouble with the National Industrial Court and the Nigerian Labour Congress over its refusal to comply with a Court’s ruling.
The National Industrial Court had last week, September 17th gave a ruling ordering the Company to reinstate 1,500 workers it had sacked on earlier. The management of La Casera had on Sept. 14th sacked 700 workers based on what it described as invasion of its premises by hoodlums.
But in a twist, the Nigerian Labour Congress had intervened on the side of the sacked workers, and others before, asking the company to reabsorb the workers, to which the company declined.
“The Lacasera management has not recalled the affected workers since the court gave the order on Sept. 17, but they are making efforts to settle issues with us.’’
NLC said it will hold a meeting and also on the court judgment before taking any action on the matter. The NIC had granted the union its plea for an order of interim injunction restraining LaCasera management through suit no. NICN/LA/416/2015 in the Lagos Judicial Division.
The Justice O.A. Obaseki-Osaghae judgment read: “All parties are to maintain peace and take no action that will lead to a breakdown of law and order.”
Meanwhile, La Casera has filed an application to counter the motion at the same court.The hearing on the pending motions has been fixed for October 19
