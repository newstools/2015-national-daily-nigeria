A former student of Lagos State University, identified as Jojo Ubong, has been accused by group of teenagers for jeopardizing their dreams of becoming responsible members of the society as he has secretly initiated them into cult activities.
 Jojo who was reported to be holding a high rank in the Eiye Confraternity -Flying Commandant  was said to have been rusticated from University of Lagos (UNILAG) due to his involvement in cult-related offences.
 As a result of his rustication, it was learnt, he began to train others who exported the fraternity to secondary schools and have initiated several street urchins.
 A teenage male who confessed to have been initiated and was expelled as a student from Kosofe Junior College, Akanimodo-Mile12, Lagos, disclosed that the deceitful initiation into secret group by Jojo was the main reason he couldn’t pursue his dreams of becoming a medical doctor.
 Asked if he regretted becoming a cultist as a teenager, Sodik said he regretted but found it difficult to detach himself from the group blaming his guardian he lives with not being a good listener to know his evil activities.
 Sodik explaining that as “Little Airlords,” his rank in the group, they carry out heinous crime activities like drug abuse, sexual harassment, rape, jungle justice, sodomy, armed robbery and other moral vices.
 It was further learnt that Jojo has disappeared as police authorities are presently tracking him with a view to bringing him to justice especially as his group was said to have recently burgled a boutique in the Lagos metropolis.
 A source hinted National Daily that Sodik blamed parents who left their children under the whims and caprices of the hardship in the country without parental control or guidance.
However, the Lagos State police spokesperson, DSP Joe Offor could not be reached on phone for comment as his phone was saying “switched off.”
