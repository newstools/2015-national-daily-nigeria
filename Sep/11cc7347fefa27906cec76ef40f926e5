National Association of Telecom Subscribers (NATCOMS) has warned MTN to expect civil protest from Nigerian subscribers anytime soon for alleged ripping off of telecom consumers by MTN other telco firms.
This is coming on the heels of a protest staged recently by a South African rights group, Right2Know.
Chief Deolu Ogunbanjo, NATCOMS president, said that “We want them to know that Nigerians also will protest against unreasonable charges.”
 “Airtime and data bundles should not expire if they are unused,”
“The findings clearly demonstrate how the astronomically high pricing structures of South African telecommunications companies seriously affect the financial stability of many people, and also infringe on their basic and fundamental communications rights.”
Ogunbanjo said MTN and other telecoms firms will soon “hear” from Nigerians soon.
It would be recalled that Right2know recently picketed MTN Head Offices in Johannesburg in order to put an end to its “unethical profiteering.”
Right2Know recently released the Lived Costs of Communications research report.
Compiled by the Link Centre at WITS University, the report details the real experiences of the everyday consumer in South Africa, and how the high costs imposed by cellular communications companies impact on the daily lives of ordinary people.
The group, which demonstrated on the street of Johannesburg, South Africa , accused cell phone companies such as MTN of “rip-off”.
Among other things, the group demand free SMS and no expiration of airtime and data
