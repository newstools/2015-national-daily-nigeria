IN line with the desire to extend its presence to every nooks and crannies of the country, Tantalizers have extended its business chain with two new outlets in Jikwoyi, Abuja and Ile-Ife, Osun State.
At the official opening of the new outlets, the Deputy Managing Director of Tantalizers Plc, Mr. GbolahanLabinjo, said that the new outlet at Abuja, located inside Mobil Filling station, Plot 60 Jikwoyi road, was a dream comes true for customers of Tantalizers in the bustling area.
According to him, it will save the customers from walking long distances to Maraba, Wuse or Garki to enjoy the delicious pastries, meals, cakes and other mouth-watering products that the Tantalizers brand is known for.
Labinjo explained further that the Jikwoyi outlet has also provided a rare opportunity for motorists in the area to refresh with the best meals while refilling their fuel tanks.
He said the new outlet in Ile-ife is the second of its kind in the ancient town. Located along Ede road that links the popular Lagere round-about in the town, the outlet is very close to the prestigious Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU) and many studentsâ€™ hostels in the town.
While declaring the outlet open, the Deputy Managing Director of Tantalizers Plc averred that the Ile-ife second outlet was opened following the yearnings of customers, mostly located in the Lagere area and environs, for a new outlet that is closer in proximity along Ede road than the old Ilesa road outlet.
