President Muhammadu Buhari, Tuesday, said his administration would do everything within its power to ensure the safe return of the over 200 missing Chibok ‎girls.
The girls were in April 2014, abducted from the Federal Government Secondary school, Chibok, Borno State, by members of the Boko Haram terrorist sect.
The Attorney General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Mr. Abubakar Malami, SAN, who spoke when the BringBackOurGirls campaign movement visited his office in Abuja yesterday, described the abduction of the girls as “tormenting and psychologically traumatising” for the nation‎.
He said: “It is tragic for a nation to have a budget meant for arms procurement for the protection of lives and property of the citizens, and end up not having the arms but compromising the process of making adequate provisions for the protection of lives of its citizens.
“The government of President Muhammadu Buhari has demonstrated sufficient skill and commitment to the protection of lives and property within the shortest practicable time of coming into existence, it has recorded tremendous success including confronting Sambisa forest head-on with the hope rescuing the Chik girls.”
