Eagles star Moses Simon quit bachelorhood Tuesday when he wedded heartthrob Sarah at a colourful ceremony in Ibadan.
Moses Simon took a break from Belgian champions Gent to be hooked at a ceremony which was graced by several personalities including Tijjani Babangida, ex-international and special assistant to Eagles coach Sunday Oliseh, as well as Eagles stars kingsley Madu and Sylvester Igbonu and overseas-based Olanrewaju Kayode and Rasheed Olabiyi.
Several top officials of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) also attended the event.
Earlier this year, Moses and his bride did a traditional engagement in Abuja.
