Federal government will on January 2016 unveil a new national blue-print for the Information Communication Technology (ICT) industry, according to Adebayo Shittu, ‎minister of Communications.
Industry watchers have argued that since Nigeria experienced change of government which ushered in President Muhammadu Buhari; the federal government is yet to come up with a national policy that will reflect the focal goals of the ruling government for the $32billion dollar valued ICT industry and this does not in any way an open door for investors.
Nigeria has in the last years being a destination for foreign investors who are really looking into Africa to invest and Nigeria has always been eye catching and the sector is therefore projected to double its $32billion valued ICT sector if opened to more foreign direct investments
On the national level the sector expected to increase and compete for a top spot in terms of sectors contribution to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
But, last-week the Minister said thus far work has been underway in the bid to get it right from the start saying “By third week of January 2016, we will officially introduce a new blue-print for the ICT” urging stakeholders and Nigerians to really exercise patience but raising hope for a new dawn in the industry.‎
“That new government is now on board with a change agenda which will not exempt the ICT industry is certain and that there will be a clear cut guild which will be introduced soon.”
Though stakeholders have been setting agenda for the industry since the new minister resumes office which has given the erudite barrister ample opportunity to be abreast with the technology driven industry as the federal government is being urged to focus on ICT to diversify the economy.
Meanwhile, various advocacy and professional groups in the industry including indigenous (Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMS) and trade partners have been calling for more patronage of local investors thereby calling for the implementation of local content policy as a way forward.
Nigeria Computer Society (NCS), one of the advocacy and professional bodies in the IT industry recent made some recommendations for the new government in power stating that government should give priority to registered local IT professionals and registered companies to execute IT jobs.
The topmost umbrella group also recommends that the federal government should appoint seasoned IT professionals on the board of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) so as to maximize and deepen the benefits of e-governance and digital transformation for the country.
Succint to note that the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA) which has been championing the course of ensuring the implementation of local content in the executions of multinational and national companies in the sector still have work to do inspite landmark efforts.
NITDA recently asked that all companies operating within the ICT sector to have and submit a local content development plan to the NITDA/NCC for job creation, development of human capital, recruitment of local engineers and value creation but this has not does been effectively admistered.
Recall that the guidelines require multinational companies (MNCs) to register their entities with the Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC) and carry on value adding services that promote local content value creation.
In addition, the regulatory instructions also mandate all multinational companies to submit details of their Nigeria content programs from the inception of the rules not later but years after the policy was not sustained.
But, industry watcher and the entire stakeholder are expecting that when the federal government finally release the blue-print in January it would restructure and develop a strong indigenous ICT industry by addressing three core areas of driving indigenous innovation; establishing intellectual property regulation and protection standards and developing the local ICT industr‎y.
