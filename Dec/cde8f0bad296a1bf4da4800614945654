The Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) has reconstituted its Emergency Committee.
A statement issued by Ademola Olajire, NFF Assistant Director of Communications, said that other standing committees and judicial bodies would be reconstituted in due course.
“As prescribed by the statutes, NFF President Amaju Pinnick is the chairman of the Emergency Committee, with first Vice President, Seyi Akinwunmi as his deputy.
“ The membership of NFF emergency committee is drawn from across the geopolitical zones, with Chief Felix Anyansi-Agwu reappointed as the Chairman of the Technical and Development Committee, representing the South-East.
“Yusuf Ahmed-Fresh retained his position as the Chairman of the Referees Committee representing the North-Central, while Babagana Kalli is the Chairman of the Players’ Status Committee representing the North-East.
“Ibrahim Gusau is still the Chairman of Chairmen representing the North-West,’’ the statement said.
It said that NFF General Secretary, Mohammed Sanusi, would serve as the Secretary of the Emergency Committee.
NFF President Amaju Pinnick announced the dissolution of the federation’s 18 standing committees and two judicial bodies immediately after the 71st Annual General Assembly which took place in Abuja on Dec. 16.
