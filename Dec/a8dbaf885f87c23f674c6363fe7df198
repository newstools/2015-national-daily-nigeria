A Federal High Court in Abuja has fixed Feb. 16 to rule on whether or not to dismiss charges of N2bn fraud and money laundering preferred against former Chairman of Nigeria Football Federation Lulu and three others.
Lulu and the other co-defendants are standing trial over alleged misappropriation of 2010 World Cup funds.
Justice Evoh Chukwu fixed the date following his inability to deliver a ruling in an application for a “no- case submission’’ filed by the defendants.
“No-case submission is made by a defendant that the other party has no evidence, or lacks sufficient legal grounds to make a case for the defendant to rebut. A successful no-case submission results in end of the trial.
Justice Chukwu said: “this case was adjourned till today for the court to rule on the application for no-case submission by the defendants.
“The ruling of the court is not ready. I am indeed sorry this is happening. I am slightly under the weather.
“The matter is, therefore, adjourned till Feb. 16 for ruling.’’
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), reports that Lulu, Amanze Uchegbulam, Taiwo Ogunjobi and Bolaji Ojo-Oba are standing trial on an eight-count charge bordering on corruption and money laundering filed by EFCC.
They are alleged to have fraudulently distributed World Cup tickets, made illegal payment of estacodes and allowances to 220 Nigerians who attended the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.
The defendants are also alleged to have purchased two Marcopolo buses without following due process.
The defendants pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Their lawyers, Sunday Ameh (SAN), and Akin Olujinmi (SAN), argued that Lulu-led administration left N2.8 billion behind when he was impeached on June 2, 2010.
They contended that their clients had no case to answer and urged the court to dismiss the case.
Lawyer to EFCC, Mr Titus Ashaolu (SAN), on the other hand, urged the court to treat the application with disfavour
