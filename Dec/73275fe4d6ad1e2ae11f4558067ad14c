The Electricity Meter Manufacturers Association of Nigeria on Wednesday, appealed to the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) to compel power Distribution Companies (Discos) to procure meters from local manufacturers.
Executive Secretary of the association, Mr Muyideen Ibrahim, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos that the importation of meters by the Discos had crippled local manufacturers of the item.
He said that the promotion of indigenous meter manufacturers would boost their business and create more job opportunities in the sector.
Ibrahim reiterated that local manufacturers had the capacity to meet the needs of the companies.
“ Government should be strongly committed in the promotion of local content because we want to be part of the growth in electricity sector.
“If the government compels the Discos to patronize local manufacturers, it will demonstrate its commitment to the local content policy,’’ he said.
Ibrahim urged NERC to liberalise the metering arm of the power sector to allow consumers and vendors to buy meters directly from indigenous meter manufacturers.
