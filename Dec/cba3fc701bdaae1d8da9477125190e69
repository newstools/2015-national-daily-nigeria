The Nigerian Police Force have warned members of the public against falling prey to the antics of fraudstars who are using fake Facebook to solicit for applications for enlistment into the Nigerian Police.
In a statement by the Force Public Relations Officer, (FPPRO) ACP Olabisi Kolawole in Abuja said that there was no recruitment exercise currently going on in the force in any institution, Command or formation.
She implores interested individuals who have the intention to enlist into the force to watch out as the force would use appropriate channels to communicate with the public as well as place advertisement in the media when the need arose.
ACP Kolawole warned Nigerians not to make any monetary commitment to any fraudstar masquerading on facebook and other social media platforms. He advised them to call the Force Public Relations office and any other Police PRO across the country whenever in doubt on all issues relating to recruitment and other policing matters.
The statement read : It has come to the knowledge of the Nigeria Police Authorities that many young and able-bodied Nigerian Youths desirous of enlisting into the Nigeria Police Force are being hoodwinked by fraudsters into believing that the Force is currently engaged in recruitment/enlistment exercise.
*It has therefore become necessary once again to inform members of the public that no recruitment/enlistment exercise is taking place now at the Force Headquarters or at any of our institutions, Commands and Formations.
However, the Force will duly inform the general public whenever it intends to commence recruitment of personnel through appropriate channels, including public advertisements in the media.
The Public is therefore advised not to fall victim, by making monetary payments or any other consideration to fraudsters masquerading through Facebook and other website platforms as agents of the Police.
