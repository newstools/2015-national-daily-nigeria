Sodiq Taiwo, a former number one ranked male player in the country says he trains thrice weekly to train harder to remain in contention against the up coming younger players.
Taiwo, who spoke with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Sunday, said that claim by some pundit that he “is now an old and weak player’’ was not true.
Taiwo added that the outgoing year had been tasking, stressing that he looked forward to better performance in 2016.
“This year has been full of drama; it is hard to come to terms with being called an old player, it’s hard for me to accept that, since I have improved in my game.
“As a so called old player, I was underrated, which is actually a good thing because it has kept me on my toes, I now play squash like my life depends on it.
“Being referred to as an old player in the midst of the young players has been inspiring me.
“Although it’s been easy but with God and constant training, I will get better like an old wine,’’ Taiwo said.
He commended the professional Squash Players Association of Nigeria (PSPAN) on their ability to keep players under their purview busy all through the year.
“This outgoing year has not been an easy one, but our association has done a great job by engaging us in various competitions; playing regularly keeps us on our toes.
“Although, we still need more in order to play competitively with other players around the world,’’ he added.
Taiwo defeated Wale Amao 3-1 in the end of the year “Grand Slam“ organised PSPAN and sponsored by some squash patrons.
