Following a failed attack on the city of Maiduguri by the Islamic Sect, Boko Haram, members of the sect have reportedly detonated explosion in three different areas of the metropolis, killing at leats, 31 people at Bullumkuttu, Bakassi area and Damboa road behind CBN quarter.
Resident of the area told our correspondent that the explosion that rocked the state capital this morning killed a resident of Bakassi ward, Bulama Modu Gana along with three others. Another IED that exploded at Bullumkuttu also killed 20 people, while the one which occurred at Damboa road behind CBN quarters killed another 6 people with several others reportedly injured.
According to Kabiru Tijjani, a member of the civilian JTF at Bullumkuttu, many of the suicide bombers got into town during the attempt by the insurgents to take over the city on Sunday.
“The street of Maiduguri is empty as everybody is in their houses, except for us civilian JTF and soldiers.” He said.
Residents who also spoke on the attack yesterday and the suicide bombing this morning said, their prayers is for God to intervene because the insurgents seemed to have regrouped.
“After several failed attempt to take over Maiduguri, these people are still coming to attack again. This is not good, most especially now that we are seeing the effort of the military. If not for the interception of the fighters yesterday, Maiduguri would have been terrible this morning.” Sidi Auwal told Our Correspondent.
