The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, on Tuesday urged the Corporate Council of Africa (CCA), an NGO, to partner with his ministry to revive culture in the country.
Mohammed made the call when Mr Ekenem Isichei, the West Africa Lead of CCA, led a delegation on a courtesy visit to his office in Abuja.
The minister stressed the need to revive the moribund art, craft and culture in some parts of the country with a view to creating economy in the culture industry.
According to him, the beauty of creating economy around culture will reduce migration of people from the rural to urban areas.
“There is no better time for the CCA to partner with us than now when we are looking to new area of diversification of economy, especially in art, culture, tourism, agriculture and solid minerals.
“We hope that you will be able to do this with our ministry in the area of culture and tourism.
“We believe that this country is blessed in the area of culture that if we decide today to have a festival per day in Nigeria, we can afford it.
“This is simply a matter of each state giving 10 cities or communities that we will be celebrating their culture, art and craft.
“Then, we will have a calendar to guide the visitors on exactly when the festival is holding’,’ he said.
Earlier, Isichei said 11the council focuses on trade policy and investment, adding that the purpose of the visit was to support the Federal Government’s change agenda.
He said the council would partner with government in the areas of agriculture and cultural orientation to enhance vibrant economy, sound value, ethics and behaviour.
