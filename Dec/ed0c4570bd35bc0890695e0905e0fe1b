At the recent reopening of the restaurant’s lunch buffet tagged, ‘Papillon Food-Tasting Lunch’, the General Manager of the hotel, Mr. NoumanIrshad , stated that the hotel initiated the food-tasting event as part of the re-introduction of an elevated lunch experience for our in-house guests and walk in customers.

Speaking further, the General Manager stated that, “The primary essence of providing our guests with both options of an indoor and outdoor venue is to present a dynamic and seamless dining experience where one can choose to enjoy their meal in the midst of pure nature if you are an eco-friendly enthusiast or recharge your senses during lunch breaks where you can relax in-room, after your intense morning meetings or over a midday meal with friends and family.”
