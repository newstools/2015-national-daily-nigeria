As Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) said it had disbursed N64.7 billion of the N213 billion earmarked for power sector intervention, the Governor, Godwin Emefiele has announced that the fund is for purchase of meters, rehabilitation of transformers.
The CBN Deputy Head, Infrastructure Development Finance Office,  Mr Boma Benebo, made this known after inspecting 62,021 prepaid meters procured by Kano Electricity Distribution Company (KEDCO) in Kano State.
He said the CBN-Nigerian Electricity Market Stabilisation Facility intervention had assisted in the restoration of 905 megawatts in the national grid following the turn around maintenance carried out at some facilities.
According to him, the intervention has also enabled DISCOs to purchase 171,071 meters, rehabilitation of over 332 kilometres of 11KV lines and 130 kilometres of 0.45KV lines.
“These investments are expected to reduce losses and significantly improve electricity delivery to Nigerians.”
Similarly, the Managing Director of KEDCO, Dr Jamil Gwamna, represented by the company’s Operating Officer, Mr Rahul Singh, said the organisation had received N7.6 billion from the CBN.
He said the money would be used to purchase meters and improve distribution networks.
He said the facility would enable the company to stabilise power supply in the three states it is serving – Kano, Katsina and Jigawa.
The money was set aside in February to tackle the poor power supply in the country.
