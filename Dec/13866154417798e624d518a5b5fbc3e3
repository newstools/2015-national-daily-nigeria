THE Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority has warned all airlines to obtain en-route and destination weather information from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NIMET) before their flight operations stating that it has become necessary due to the hazardous weather associated with the harmattan period.
In a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) circulated, the regulatory authority stated that NIMET has forecast the occurrence of moderate to severe outbreaks of dust in the country during this harmattan period: November 2015 to March 2016.
The circular also highlighted that severe outbreaks of dusts can reduce atmospheric visibility significantly and thus impact negatively on flight operations.
Based on the above, the regulatory body issued a circular to all Airline Operators and Pilots to comply with certain safety measures which include: Ensuring that adequate departure, en route and destination weather information are obtained from NIMET prior to flight operations; Exercising maximum restraint when adverse weather is observed or forecasted by NIMET and Ensuring that flight operations are scheduled with adequate weather information from NIMET to minimise delay or cancellation of flight operations.
The NCAA further told operators to always strictly comply with laid down Regulations and State minima.
