FMDQ OTC Securities Exchange (FMDQ) has assured stakeholders in the over-the-counter (OTC) fixed income securities market of better deal.
The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of FMDQ OTC, Mr. Bola Onadele Koko, gave the assurance while speaking at the 2015 annual workshop of the Capital Market Correspondents Association of Nigeria (CAMCAN) in Lagos.
Speaking through the Head, Business Development, FMDQ OTC, Ms. Tumi Sekoni, Koko said having succeeded in turning around the market within two years, the next move is to bring more innovations that will benefit all stakeholders and make the platform more attractive to issuers and investors.
According to him, FMDQ OTC has not only deepened the fixed income debt securities market but has also made it very liquid for investors to enter and exit.
Onadele disclosed that while the platform has been quoting federal government and corporate bonds of public companies among others, there are plans to quote bonds of private companies as part of its commitment to support efforts aimed at galvanizing the development of the Nigerian economy.
“FMDQ will establish the requisite market governance over these private companies bonds as part of its investor protection standards in making the Nigerian debt capital market globally competitive to attract pension funds and foreign capital,” he said.
He added that FMDQ is establishing the building blocks to redefine access to long-term debt capital for private companies and ventures in Nigeria.
