NIGERIA coach Samson Siasia gave $100 to each of his players for qualifying for the semi-final of the U23 AFCON and thereafter vowed they will play to beat hosts Senegal on Wednesday to reach the championship final.
Siasia redeemed a pledge to pay his players cash for reaching the last four of the U23 championship, which doubles as a qualifier for the 2016 Rio Olympics, after they held Algeria to a scoreless draw on Saturday in Dakar.
He then fixed his sights on reaching the U23 AFCON final at the expense of home team Senegal by 4pm Nigerian time on Wednesday.
“I would have preferred Senegal in the final, but I have to do at the semis,” said Siasia.
“It will be a great match because they will have the public behind them and we have to play and win.”
He said he hopes to inspire his team to progress to the final after he scored against Senegal in the 1992 AFCON in Dakar.
“At the Africa Cup of Nations in 1992, I scored here (Leopold Sedar Senghor Stadium), and this is why most Nigerians remember me, I will be around my players to repeat it on Wednesday,” he said.
He said he was satisfied his team kept a clean sheet after capitulating in the second half of their two previous group games.
“I congratulate my team for not conceding and qualifying for the semi-finals,” he remarked.
