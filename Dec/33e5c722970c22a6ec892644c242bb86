Warri Wolves striker Gbolahan Salami and Chima Akas from Sharks are the only players yet to rejoin the Super Eagles CHAN training camp.
Twenty four players trained twice on Sunday with officials disclosing that Salami and Akas did not beat the Saturday night deadline issued by the coaches because of travel difficulties.
“We had 24 players in our first training on Sunday with only Salami and Chima Akas still being expected after they encountered some difficulties coming down,” said top team official Patrick Pascal.
The Eagles are expected to fly out to Pretoria, South Africa, their training camp on January 2.
They are scheduled to play two warm-up matches against CHAN-bound Angola and Cote d’Ivoire.
