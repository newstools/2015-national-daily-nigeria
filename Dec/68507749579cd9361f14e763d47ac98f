Somali security agencies are on alert to ban any Christmas gathering across the country as Christians all over the world prepare to celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ December 25.
Only the UN compounds and AU peacekeepers bases will have the luxury of celebrating the Yuletide.
According to the BBC, the reason Mogadishu gave was that Christmas is Christian in nature, and it’s capable of rocking the state religion—Islam.
Besides that, such gatherings could become target for the terrorist group Al-Shabab,  the mayor of Mogadishu, Yusuf Hussein Jimale, told the BBC .
Somali went all out to choose a state religion six years ago, and has since been operating under Sharia law.
Other countries around the world where Xmas is a no-no include Afghanistan, Algeria, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bhutan, Cambodia, Iran, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Laos, Libya, Maldives, Mauritania, North Korea, Oman, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Tajikistan, Brunei, Thailand, Turkmenistan, and United Arab.
