The President, Shippers’ Association Lagos State, Mr Jonathan Nicol, on Monday advised the Nigerian Shippers’ Council (NSC) as the port economic regulator to enforce operating standards by port operators.
Nicol gave the advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos while unfolding the association’s expectations for 2016.
He said the rules of imports and exports must also be obeyed.
“We believe 50 per cent of cargo lost to other African countries will find their way back to our ports.
“All practitioners should have what it takes to perform their statutory duties. The more cargo we have in Nigeria, the better for all.
“We have set the ball rolling for the acceleration of the new port order and government is geared toward revamping Nigerian ports,’’ the shipper told NAN.
Nicol said all these would create wealth for the people, provide employment and assist in revenue generation by government.
He suggested that all “unhealthy’’ import polices should be reviewed to boost cargo throughput (imports and exports) in 2016.
Nicol said that a review of the auto policy would fetch more revenue for the government.
According to him, all government agencies involved in maritime administration should reverse excessive charges like shipping costs and terminal charges.
The shipper also noted that transportation (haulage) costs should be pegged at an acceptable level.
“Port access road connecting Apapa to Tin-Can Island port from Mile 2 and Marine Beach end should be rebuilt to ease movement of goods and personnel.
“Offloading of empty boxes (containers) should be accelerated by the shipping lines and exported out of the country regularly.
“A new bridge across Olodi Apapa to Marine Road in Lagos should be a priority,’’ Nicol said.
