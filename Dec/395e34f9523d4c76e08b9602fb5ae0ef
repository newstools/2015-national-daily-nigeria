In dicey circumstance, the Kogi State House of Assembly, today impeached the Speaker, Momoh Jimoh.
The Speaker, according to a report was alleged to have soil his hands through financial recklessness. In addition, it was learnt that Momoh was impeached because he is from the same local government with the governor-elect.
Under the same doubtful circumstance, though he was alleged to have been involved in financial carelessness, out of 25 members, only 17 signed for the removal of Momoh
National Daily learnt that both Mr. Momoh and the newly elected Governor Yahaya Bello are from Okene Local Government Area (LGA) which may have factored into his impeachment to ensure a balance of power in the state.
The new Speaker of the Kogi State House of Assembly is Godwin Osiyi in a House comprised of 14 members of the Peoples Democratic Party and 11 members of the All Progressives Congress.
