This certification signifies that the Skyway Aviation handling Company Limited at the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano has now modeled its operations to the ISAGO standards, as a result making a commitment to operate to globally accepted industry best practices.
The registration which is in accordance with the provisions of the ISAGO Program Manual covers the operational disciplines of Load Control (LOD), Passenger and Baggage Handling (PAB), Aircraft Handling and loading (HDL), Aircraft Ground Movement (AGM), and Cargo and Mail Handling (CGM).
The Skyway Aviation Handling Company limited’s Lagos Station was first certified in 2011. The certification of the Kano Station now brings to three (Lagos, Abuja and Kano) the number of SAHCOL stations admitted on the IATA website as an “ISAGO Registered Provider”, having undergone an ISAGO Audit and cleared all findings..
ISAGO audit is essential to promote safer ground operations, understanding of high risk areas within ground operations. The audit also eliminates redundant audits from airlines, hence promoting a uniform audit process and harmonized standards that improve quality standards in aviation ground handling.
The Skyway Aviation handling Company Limited became a SIFAX Group Company in December 2009, after its successful privatization by the Federal Government of Nigeria. Within this period, SAHCOL has invested in personnel development, purchase of modern ground handling equipment, infrastructural development and good customer services, which has helped reposition the company to meet the expectations and needs of its growing list of clientele.
