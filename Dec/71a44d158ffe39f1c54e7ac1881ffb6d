A Lagos lawmaker and close confidant of the aggrieved Kogi State running mate of deceased APC Gubernatorial candidate, Hon. James Abiodun Faleke has restated the need for him to set the records straight via judicial procedures, so as to deepen Nigeria’s fledging democracy.
According to Hon. Segun Olulade, member representing Epe II constituency, we will still have to go to court to deepen our democracy.
“This is necessary so that somebody would not come up with something that would destroy our democracy tomorrow because the word ‘inconclusive’ has become the order of the day today, so that the people would not use ‘inconclusive’ in any matter that should have been declared ‘conclusive.’
The legislator who doubles as the House Health Committee Chairman, commenting on the deplorable state of health facilities in Lagos noted that it will no longer be business as usual in the sector.
“You would recall that the first statement I issued as the Chairman of the Health Committee had to do with efficiency in our health centres and our hospitals. Now, it would not be business as usual in the sector”.
He stressed that,” We would ensure that there is efficiency in our health system. We are aware of the nonchalant attitude of some doctors and nurses in the state, we will not tolerate that again. We are creating a zero tolerance on inefficiency in our health sector. We will ensure that everyone that lives in Lagos or has anything to do with the state has a qualitative healthcare.
We will perform our oversight functions, visit all the health centres and hospitals in Lagos State. We want to have a turn-around in the sector and efficiency that is not common in this part of the world.
