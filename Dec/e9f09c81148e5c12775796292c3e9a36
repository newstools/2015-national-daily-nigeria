The Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) in Lekki, Lagos, has advised motorists to drive with caution this festive period.
The FRSC Lekki Unit Commander, Mr Olufemi Olonisaye, gave this advice in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) after a programme tagged; Flag Off Motor Park Rally at Ajah, Lagos, on Saturday.
He particularly warned motorists against the use of bad tyres, especially the ones referred to as “tokunbo’’ otherwise called fairly used tyres.
The motor park rally has “Operation Sanity: Driving safely into 2016’’as its theme.
According to him, the rally was part of the FRSC ember months programme to educate, sensitise motorists as well as create awareness for all road users on safety during these festivities.
”Yuletide is always characterised with heavy human and vehicular movement, therefore, drivers need to drive safely and adhere strictly to the rules and regulations guiding the use of roads,” he said.
Olonisaye, however, urged motorists to shun all unsafe practices as speeding, driving under the influence of alcohol, overloading and use of mobile phone while driving.
“Your actions or inactions will either cause or prevent Road Traffic Crashes (RTC). Remember that only the living can celebrate, drive to stay alive,’’ the FRSC commander said.
He said road safety was an issue of national concern and should not be left alone to FRSC personnel because it should normally be everyone’s business.
Olonisaye noted that Nigerians were not always conscious with safety until when crashes occurred, saying that this was evident in the frequency of road crashes in Nigeria.
The unit commander said that these road crashes had become a matter of concern to the government and the traffic agencies.
Olonisaye noted that researches had shown that a good percentage of road crashes in Nigeria was due to human factor.
