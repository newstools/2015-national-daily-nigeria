The National president of Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN), Mr Ayoola Oduntan on Wednesday, in Lagos, decried the poor sales of chicken and eggs during the Christmas season due to the stockpiling of smuggled poultry products which flooded the market during the festive season.
Oduntan who also lamented the low patronage of local poultry products, attributing it to lack of specialised market for farmers to sell their products, urged the Federal Government to create the right market for Nigerian products.
The PAN President further called for the patronage of government agencies by using Nigerian chickens in their menus as a means of promoting local consumption, adding that the government should intensify their effort in promoting the consumption of local poultry products.
“Charity must begin at home; all government agencies must encourage their caterers to use made-in-Nigeria chickens in their daily meals and other services. The right economic environment, in terms of market, must be created because many farm produce do not get to the market,’’ Oduntan said.
