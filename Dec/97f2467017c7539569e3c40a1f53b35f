Gov. Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto state on Sunday pledged to sustain the non-discriminatory policy on payment of school fees introduced by his predecessor, Sen. Aliyu Wamakko.
Tambuwal said this in Sokoto when he hosted the Primate of Church of Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Most Rev. Nicholas Okoh, who led members of the church on a Christmas courtesy visit.
He said: “Às part of measures to boost communal harmony, my administration will sustain the policy of non-discriminatory fees paid by all students in public schools started by the last administration.”
The equally invited all Nigerians willing to contribute to the development of education to come to the state and exhibit their talents.
He enjoined Christians to also sustain the centuries old peaceful and harmonious co-existence with their neighbours in the state.
Okoh had earlier said that Nigeria can learn a lot from Sokoto’s peaceful disposition for rapid development of the country.
He said: “Even though there a one or two issues with conflicts in Sokoto in the past, that has not affected the overall peaceful disposition of the state.”
The cleric commended the Sokoto Government for its efforts in promoting harmony among diverse religious and ethnic groups in the state.
While urging all Nigerians to take the issue of protection of environment seriously, Okoh said the dangers posed by desertification is real and should be accorded the attention it deserves.
