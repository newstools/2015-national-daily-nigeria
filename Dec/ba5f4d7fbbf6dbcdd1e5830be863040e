From Mike Tayese, Yenagoa
As the Buhari administration is battling with various militia group ranging from Boko Haram, the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) and other crises coupled with the dwindling economy, a frontline and dreaded militant group in the Niger Delta region, Egbesu Mightier Fraternity, has warned the President, Muhammadu Buhari  and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) to desist forthwith the prosecution and investigation of their leaders, as they will leave no stone unturned to protect the interest of the region especially the sons and daughters of the area.
The group specifically asked government to hands off the trial of Chief Government Ekpemupolo, aka as Tompolo and Dr Patrick Akpobolokemi, former Director General of the Nigerian Maritime Safety Agency (NIMASA) currently being investigated and tried by the EFCC.
In a press statement shortly after their meeting in Yenagoa and made available to National Daily, Egbesu described the invitation of Tompolo by the EFCC as childish and laughable, stressing that what the federal government is looking for will be given to them in earnest.
Reading the address on behalf of others, one of the ex-militant General, Oleke Okins, said its high time the Niger Delta region go there way if the Nigerian government was not ready to accommodate them any longer.
The meeting which was attended by twelve top freedom fighters, expressed their determination to completely cripple the economy if the President dared them by continuing to harass their leaders.
“With oil prices slipping below 40 dollars a barrel, if the government of President Buhari is willing, we will help to reduce its price of barrel to 15 dollars. Nigeria will collapse under the watch of All Progressive Congress (APC) and President Muhammadu Buhari as we will ‎do everything necessary to actualize the American prediction of splitting the country.
According to them, the silence in the region is a legacy of former President Umaru Musa Yar’Adua and should not be thrown away on the altar of vindictiveness, warning that the government should thread with caution and wisdom by ensuring that anything capable of provoking anger in the region is avoided or else every region shall maintain their respective resources because the money belongs to the people of the region and not APC and Buhari government.
“We are giving  the Buhari administration the next two weeks to rescind its decision to probe Tompolo, Patrick Akpobolokemi, Engozu Kime and others or otherwise Nigeria will be history as predicted by
Americans”, General Oleke Okins warned.
