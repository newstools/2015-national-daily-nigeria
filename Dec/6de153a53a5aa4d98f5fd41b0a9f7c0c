For the fourth times in two months, the Department of State Security Service has defied the court order to produce Radio Biafraâ€™s D-G Nnamidi Kanu at the Wuse Magistrate Court 11 over allegations of criminal conspiracy, engaging in unlawful society, and criminal intimidation. These allegedly violate of Sections 97, 97B and 397 of the Penal Code.
Although the magistrate, His Lord Usman Suaibu, lost his father and could not appear in court December 1 for which the last hearing was slated, the DSS had insisted the case should be transferred to a higher court because of its latest findings.
And that is the more reason the agency still holds onto his prisoner who has met his bail requirements, including a landed property in Abuja, and a Grade 16 civil servant for a surety.
Many political analysts, however, believe the DSS is over-reaching itself in carrying out its statutory function, citing former NSA Dasuki Sambo whom the federal government has refused to release on court orders.
