The Executive Director, Nigerian Investment Promotion Commission (NIPC), Mrs Uju Baba, on Saturday said that more than 100 foreign investors had visited the country between June and December.
Baba, who disclosed to reporters in Abuja, said Nigeria remained an investment destination in Africa.
She, however, said that the investment business was slow, adding, “because we are going through post election period, government activities have slowed down to certain extent and that affects the investment climate”.
“Many investors are coming on exploratory visit to find out what Nigeria can offer to them. So, from June to December 2015, we received more than 100 exploratory visits,’’ she stressed.
She said that since the appointment of ministers by President Muhammadu Buhari, the country had received different set of investors.
“They are no more on exploratory visit, they are coming to the commission to facilitate meetings with the various sectors and ministries,’’ Baba said.
He said the investors had confidence in the country’s investment climate despite the challenges they may encounter.
The director called on the investors to go through the commission for proper legal framework as the present administration was more concerned with rule of law and due process.
