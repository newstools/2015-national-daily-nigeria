FC Taraba players remained undaunted in their quest to recover the debts owed by the state government as they spent the fourth night outside the state Government House in Jalingo.
The players are pressing for the release of their over 12 months salary arrears in front of the Taraba Government house for the fourth day but are yet to get any response from the appropriate quarters.
The players are resolved on getting substantial part of their salary arrears after the government made promise and failed to deliver on past promises to release the money approved for them.
A source close to the club said the players have been resuming in front of the Government House in Jalingo and always stay till late in the night after running out of patience with the state government’s insensitivity to their plight.
He noted that the players have vowed to continue the action until they are paid their dues as they have been impoverished despite ensuring that they put their best on display in all the league matches played last season.
“Our players have been staying put in front of the Taraba Government House in Jalingo and they have said they would remain there until they are answered but sadly no one in government has come to address them. They have spent four nights already and are determined to continue as such until they receive their pay.
“This is no encouragement to footballers and it has rubbished the good work of the League Management Company (LMC) and that of the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) because they can’t claim to be working when major stakeholders of the game – the players – are going about with empty stomachs,” be said.
FC Taraba, dogged by financial crisis for most part of the campaign last season were and relegated to the lower league.
