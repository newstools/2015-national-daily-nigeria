FOR over a decade it was a nightmare for the 37-year old Mrs Omowunmi Oyebamiji and her husband because of their childlessness.
But September 6 would remain evergreen in their lives. Omowunmi gave birth to tripletall girls. The arrival of the babies brought jubilation to the couple, their church, the Infinite Glory Baptist Church, and their neighbourhood in the Meiran area of Lagos.
The bundles of joy, however, brought something more: the burden of care. The couple, unluckily, aren’t empowered enough to shoulder this. And that’s already damping their excitement. Omowunmi is a petty trader while her husband, a graduate of mechanical engineering, is unemployed.
The mother of three, in spite of the odds, still believes her girls have rights to live. So dumping them—or dashing them out to the state government—is never an option.
She and her husband now appeal to well-meaning Nigerians for assistance, in any form, to help give the kids the life they deserve.
