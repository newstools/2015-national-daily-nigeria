The Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) in Bayelsa, arrested 40 suspected oil thieves and destroyed 106 illegal refineries in 2015.
Mr Desmond Agu, the state Commandant of the NSCDC, made the disclosure on Wednesday in Yenagoa while briefing newsmen on the activities of the command in the outgoing year.
He said that the command recorded “appreciable success’’ in its fight against oil theft, pipelines vandalism and other illegalities during the year under review.
He said that operatives of the command also recovered some items used by vandals for their illegal activities.
Agu listed the items to include: 10 locally made boats, eight speed boats, one lorry, 10 pumping machines, 20 boat engines and six motorcycles.
Others included: a bus, four taxi cabs, four wheelbarrows, 10 hoses, 55,000 litres of Automotive Gas Oil (Diesel) and 5,000 litres of Dual Purpose Kerosene.
He said that the command collaborated with some multi-national companies operating in the state to safeguard their facilities and pipelines.
“We are also active in internal security in the state.
“We are a component of the state security outfit, Operation Doo Akpo to provide security in conjunction with the police.
“We also have quick intervention force at the state headquarters to respond to distress calls.
“We have a Disaster Management Unit that responds to emergency situations like vehicular accidents and fire outbreak,” Agu said.
The commandant commended the Federal and Bayelsa State Governments, the Commandant-General of NSCDC and the media for their support during the outgoing year.
He urged the Federal Government to do more in the provision of equipment and logistics, which he said, were the major challenges facing the command.
