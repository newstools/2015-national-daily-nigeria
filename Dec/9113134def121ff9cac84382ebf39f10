Gov. Aminu Tambuwal of Sokoto State, has promised that his administration will not sack any teacher from the state civil service.
“But we will not fail to reassign any teacher that does not have the requisite qualifications to be in the classroom,” Tambuwal said on Monday in Dogon-Daji, Tambuwal Local Government Area.
The governor made the promise in his address at the annual national congress of the old Boys’ association of his Alma-mater, Government Secondary School, Dogon Daji.
He said: “Beginning from the next budget, government will ensure continuous training and retraining of teachers to update their knowledge and make them conform to modern teaching techniques.
“Huge sums of money have been budgeted for that purpose.
“Let me announce it here that we do not plan to retrench any teacher working with the state government.
“In fact we need qualified teachers to address shortfall in numbers.
“What we will not condone in our schools are unqualified teachers who have nothing to offer our children.
“If after giving you the necessary training, we discovered that you do not have the capacity or enthusiasm to teach, we will reassign you to where your expertise if most needed.”
While commending the executive of the association for its diligence in the face of mounting challenges, Tambuwal solicited its support in government’s efforts to take Sokoto state to greater heights.
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that at the end of the congress, Alhaji Nasiru Idris was elected national President of the association while Abdullahi Muhammed was elected Secretary.
