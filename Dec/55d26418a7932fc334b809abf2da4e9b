The National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers (NUPENG) on Friday assured Nigerians that the current scarcity of petrol would soon come to an end.
Alhaji Tokunbo Korodo, the South-West Chairman of the union gave the assurance in an interview with newsmen in Lagos.
The Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, had, on Dec. 9, confirmed the payment of N407.07 billion fuel subsidy to oil marketers.
Korodo said that there was massive loading of petroleum products in different depots in Lagos and other parts of the country.
“There is massive loading of petroleum products in different depots throughout the country, and our Petroleum Tanker Drivers are ready to go extra mile to deliver the product to designated filling stations.
“Our team of tanker drivers will work round the clock to ensure that the product gets to their destinations.
‘Well, tentatively, before Christmas period the queues will vanish at filling stations across the country,” he said.
Korodo urged the Federal Government to ensure that subsidy claims were paid on time to avoid recurrent scarcity of petrol in the country.
He also advised the oil marketers to accelerate importation of the product to ensure that it was available in all depots.
The chairman called on Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) to repair its pipeline networks throughout the country so that the product could be distributed through the channel to all its depots nationwide.
