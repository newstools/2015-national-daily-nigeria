From ODIMMEGWA JOHNPETER, Abuja
THE government is set to introduce in early 2016 a Technology Transfer Initiative that would encourage friendly countries that have competency and capability in Science and Technology to come to Nigeria, invest and help develop local competencies.
Government will also ensure that enabling environment is created for such investors so that they would have adequate returns for their investments and reap commensurate rewards for their efforts.
This was stated today in Abuja when the Honourable Minister of Science and Technology, Dr. Ogbonnaya Onu received the Ambassador of Spain to Nigeria Alfonso Barnuejo Sebastian in his office.
According to the minister, Nigeria has a cordial and long standing relationship with Spain and therefore invited Spain to take advantage of Nigeria’s plan to diversify its economy and the various opportunities this present, in view of the vast and abundant non-oil mineral resources available in the country.
He further urged the Ambassador to assist in establishing collaboration between research and development agencies under the ministry with their counterparts in Spain as a means of strengthening their competencies and capabilities.
In his remarks, Ambassador Sebastian expressed satisfaction with the long and excellent relationship between his country and Nigeria, based on trust and that his country is Nigeria’s second largest trading partner with an annual 6.2 billion Euros in favour of Nigeria.
He assured the Minister that Spain is ready to play more prominent role in the Nigerian economy especially in the non-oil sector such as renewable energy, health, agriculture, leather, bio-technology, manufacturing amongst many others.
