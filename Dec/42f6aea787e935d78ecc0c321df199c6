Barrister Solomon Dalung has promised to support Nigerian athletes as they prepare for the Olympic Games in Rio next year.
Speaking to press after Odunayo Adekuoroye qualified for the 2016 Olympics on Sunday, the Minister of Sports said “Wrestling is one of the sports we’re expecting Nigeria to do well in at Rio.”
“I believe that if Adekuoroye is given maximum support before the games, she will perform creditably well. I implore you and other athletes to keep up with the hard work as you continue to make Nigeria proud.”
“The Ministry of Youth and Sports will make all provisions needed available to Nigerian athletes to ensure that they qualify for the Olympics and perform well in Rio.”
