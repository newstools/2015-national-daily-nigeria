The Lagos State Ministry of Agriculture, Permanent Secretary, Dr Olajide Bashorun has reiterated its commitment to partnering the Federal Department of Fisheries on value addition in aquaculture activities, during the `Merry Fish Day’ organised by the state Catfish and Allied Association of Nigeria (LASCAFAN) in Lagos.
Olajide who reaffirms that the state was positioning itself to be a major fish producer in the country, says fish farming has come to stay and that there is need to develop the sector to enable farmer add value.
The PS, represented by Mr Abiodun Balogun, pointed out that the state government was in support of the Federal Government’s ban on importation of fish and urged members of the association to be ready to take up the task of providing enough fish for local consumption.
The President of the association, Mr Babafemi Ajala, who noted that the association was serving as a pressure group to influence government policies on fishery production reiterated that members were ready for the task ahead.
Awards were given to seven members of the association in recognition of their contribution to the fishery sub-sector during the celebration of the ‘Merry Fish Day’.
