EXFOLIATION and Body Scrub Marathon: It’s true, that scrubbing off dead skin helps clear the way for moisturizers to sink in, hence style and beauty lover’s addiction to it. Unfortunately “less is more” when it comes to exfoliation or body scrubs during harmattan season. Exfoliating more than once weekly during harmattan can damage the skin’s protective moisture barrier, which locks in hydration and keeps out irritants.
Using dirty make-up brushes: It may feel like the last thing you have time for, but washing your make-up brushes, ideally once a week during this season, ensures that you’re not applying dirt and bacteria to your skin with your make-up. First rinse off any residual make-up by holding the bristles under warm, running water, then cleanse with a gentle shampoo and warm water. Rinse again, then lay them flat on a towel to dry.
Drying your skin immediately after bathing. During harmattan, keeping your skin hydrated and moisturized is supreme. One quick way to keep your skin hydrated and yet facilitate the absorption of moisturizers is to let your skin dry on its own after bathing. NO TOWELLING!
Using Alcohol-Based Products especially facial cleansers and toners that contain alcohol or astringents
Ignoring Your Lips: During harmattan, forgetting to moisturize your lips before going to bed as usual, is a big no-no! Your lips have no oil glands of their own to keep them hydrated and cold weather strips it of its natural protective state resulting in chapped lips.
Bathing with Hot Water: Bathing Hot water depletes natural oils from the skin’s surface, leaving it dry and more susceptible to conditions like eczema, it’s best to use lukewarm water.
