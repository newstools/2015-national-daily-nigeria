Super Eagles Home base captain and Warri wolves Striker,  Gbolahan Salami is likely to opt out of next month’s CHAN so as to sign for a club in Europe.
The Warri Wolves striker is the only player yet to rejoin the Eagles training camp in Abuja with officials suggesting he is in the process of completing a transfer overseas.
“We have 25 players in camp now with Salami the only player yet to rejoin the camp, it’s likely he is working on a transfer abroad,” a team official disclosed on Tuesday.
Should he sign for an overseas club he will be
ineligible to feature at CHAN because the competition is reserved only for players who are playing in their home leagues.
Already early this year, a move to Serbia
collapsed after Red Star Belgrade could not pay the Nigeria striker.
He has also been linked with a move to Norway.
