The Nigerian Meteorological Agency (NiMet) has predicted dust haze weather conditions with low visibility values of less than 1000m over the central states of the country on Monday.
The predictions are contained in the Weather Outlook issued by NiMet’s Central Forecast Office (CFO) on Sunday in Abuja.
It added that moderate visibility was expected to affect places like Abuja, Kaduna, Bida, Minna, Ilorin, Bauchi and environs with night time temperature range between 12 to18 degree Celsius.
NiMet predicted that dusty atmosphere would prevail over Benin, Awka, Enugu and Port Harcourt with reduced horizontal visibility of one to 3km and night time temperature between 14 to 18 degrees Celsius.
It also predicted that Northern states would experience reduced visibility value to less than 1000m in some places with night time temperatures between 12 to 16 degrees Celsius.
According to the agency, the atmosphere is usually very dry and windy during this period of the year, warning that citizens should avoid substances that may ignite easily to reduce incidences of fire outbreaks.
“Flight operations may be disrupted due to poor visibility in some airports across the country,’’ it stated.
