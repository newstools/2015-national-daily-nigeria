…says it is anti-labour
The Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (PENGASSAN) has vowed to resist the plan by the Federal Government to retrench workers, especially employees of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation as a result of the restructuring in the proposed Petroleum Industry Bill.
The Union which condemned the restructured proposed bill as anti-labour argued that the planned sack was not in tandem with the “change” that the government promised Nigerians, especially in the area of job creation.
Reacting to the official release of the proposed draft institutional and legal frameworks for reforms in the oil and gas industry by the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, who is also Group Managing Director (GMD) of the NNPC, the group’s acting General Secretary, Comrade Lumumba Okugbawa, in a statement said the provisions in the proposed PIB are not only anti-labour but also not in the national interest.
