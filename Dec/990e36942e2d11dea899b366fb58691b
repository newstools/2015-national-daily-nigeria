Boxing Day turned tragic for some families in Lagos as a Police Sergeant shot three persons dead in a Ketu hotel before committing suicide.
The police officer, identified as Stephen James of MOPOL 22 on Oduduwa Street, Ikeja, took his own life
shortly afterwards.
The incident, it was learnt,  occurred at the Paulson Hotel located on Anibaba street in Ketu.
The Lagos state police spokesperson, Joe Offor, a Deputy Superintendent of Police who confirmed the incident to National Daily said James acted under the influence of alcohol.
According to the Liquor Act, selling alcohol to a policeman on duty on prohibited, Offor said,
adding that the owner of the hotel will be prosecuted by the Lagos State Police command.
Investigation has also been launched to determine how James got to Ketu and whether he was posted there or not.
Offor added that the bodies of the victims have been deposited at the Ikorodu General Hospital
morgue.
A witness said the police officer started “spraying bullets as if he was on warfront compelling people to flee otherwise the deaths would have been more than three.”
