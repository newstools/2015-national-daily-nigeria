John Mikel Obi became the 21st player to make 350 appearances for Chelsea in the Blues’ 2-2 draw against Watford in Saturday’s English Premier League fixture.
The Nigerian was a 46th minute substitute for Cesc Fabregas as Guus Hiddink’s team failed to subdue the Hornets at the Stamford Bridge.
Also, the feat makes him become the club’s third-highest overseas appearance maker since his move from Lyn Oslo in 2006.
“Personally it is going to be great for me if I can achieve that number,’ Mikel told Chelsea website before the game against Quique Sanchez Flores’ team.
“I also want to push on and see how many more appearances I can get. For me it has been a great time here, I still enjoy it and ever since I walked into this football club I knew this was the place for me.
“I am so happy and so proud of the amount of games I have played for this club and at the same time using these games to win trophies and medals. This is the most important thing.
“For the past 10 years we have helped build the reputation of this club and Chelsea is up there in world football. I am so proud of what I have achieved and I still want to keep going.”
