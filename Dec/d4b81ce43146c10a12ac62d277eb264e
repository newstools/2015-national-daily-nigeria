GOVERNOR Adams Oshiomhole of Edo State said, yesterday, that the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) under President Goodluck Jonathan squandered the resources of the country and that of its members.
While he pointed out that things had changed positively since the coming of President Muhammadu Buhari, he, however, asserted that “it will take time to clean up the mess of the past”.
Oshiomhole stated this while receiving over 5,000 members of the PDP in the three senatorial districts of Edo including the immediate past Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Power, Patrick Ikhariale; Abbas Braimah; and Bisi Idaomi.
The decampees were received into the party by Oshiomhole, assisted by some governorship aspirants of the APC, such as former Governor Osarhiemen Osunbor and Gen.Charles Airhiavbere, who had on several occasions urged the PDP leaders to forget pride and join Oshiomhole in moving the state forward.
“For the first time, big people are being asked to account, in the past we only hear of governors, local government people, commissioners but this time we are seeing Minister of Finance confessing like a witch craft how they took money and even co-opt their children so they didn’t just share money for the party they shared for their families. When a Minister pays money into her own personal account, we have seen national security being redefined to meet the security of a political party to secure the party in office rather than secure the nation even in the face of a devastating insurgency”, the governor stated.
