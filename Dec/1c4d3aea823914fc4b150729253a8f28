The National Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers on Monday says that petrol would soon be available in filling stations across the country.
Mr Tokunbo Korodo, the South-West Chairman of the union, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos there had been improvement on loading of petroleum at the depots in Lagos.
He observed that Nigerians would appreciate the present regime if it could reduce the price of petroleum.
National DailyÂ reports that the Minister of State for Petroleum, Dr Ibe Kachikwu, had earlier said that a price modulation in petrol would begin by January 2016.
Kachikwu disclosed this during his inspection of the Port Harcourt Refinery Company (PHRC) on Christmas day.
The NUPENG chairman said that the government meant well for all and sundry, in spite of the few greedy that worked to frustrate genuine intentions.
