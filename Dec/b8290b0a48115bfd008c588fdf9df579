Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has urged telecommunication subscribers to ensure that telecoms facilities are used only for legitimate transactions.
Abdullahi Maikano, director, Consumer Affairs Bureau at NCC, made the call at the 19th edition of Consumer Town Hall meeting held in Sagamu, Ogun State at the weekend.
Maikano who was represented by Dr. Femi Atoyebi, his deputy, called on consumers to use their telecom gadgets for correct and legitimate transactions by refraining from criminal use of telecommunication facilities.
According to him, there is need for subscribers to protect telecom infrastructures in their neighbourhood by reporting cases of vandalism to the police.
Maikano said subscribers should know their bill of rights which include right to be informed and right to quality of service among others.
Mr. Abdullahi Muhammad, unit commander, Federal Road Safety Corps (FRSC) Sagamu, joined NCC in appealing to the subscribers to desist from making phone calls or using their mobile phones while driving.’
According to him, research has shown that use of mobile phones while driving contributes to the rate of road accidents in the country.
