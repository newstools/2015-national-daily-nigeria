The Nigerian Army has warned members of the Islamic Movement of Nigeria, to desist from making misleading comments, capable of breaching public peace and order.
This is contained in a statement issued by Army spokesman, Col. Sani Usman and made available to newsmen.
“The Army is aware of clandestine campaign of calumny and misinformation on the incident of Dec.12, 2015 in Zaria.’’
He said that “a group of high ranking members of Islamic Movement of Nigeria (IMN), led by one Dr Abdullahi Danladi, a lecturer at Ahmadu Bello University Zaria,’’ had misrepresented facts about the incident.
“He was at the university on Wednesday soliciting for support and telling lies about the circumstances surrounding the incident and the incident itself.
“He also went further to make false and unfounded allegations of casualty figures and desecration of burial grounds.
“Dr Abdullahi Danladi and like minded individuals should be warned to desist from telling lies and misrepresentation of facts capable of misleading the general public.”
The statement said the actions of Danladi was preposterous and showed lack of concern and respect for peace and tranquility.
It said that the Army would not sit back and allow some mischievous elements in the society to further create unnecessary tension and disaffection in the society.
It urged the public to disregard the misleading campaign by the sect.
“This attitude will not be tolerated where people abuse their privileged position to mislead the public, create disaffection.
“Nigerians and indeed all well meaning people are please enjoined to be patient and await the outcome of the various enquiries instituted by various government and non-governmental agencies.
