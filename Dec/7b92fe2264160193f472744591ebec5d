Lucky Ndudi, a Nigerian whose automobile workshop was attacked in the xenophobic attacks in South Africa eight months ago, on Sunday appealed to the Federal Government to assist victims of the incident.
Ndudi, a 35-year-old native of Delta and father of three, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Johannesburg that he lost everything to the attacks.
“ Forty-seven cars in my mechanic garage were damaged. Some car parts and tools were stolen and the garage was burnt. I lost everything during the attack.
“ The value of the loss is R1.1million Rand or N19.7million and things have not been easy for me and my family,“ he said.
Ndudi said that after the attacks, the Nigerian Consulate in South Africa and Nigeria Union collated the inventory of damages and losses by Nigerians and sent same to the Federal Government.
“ It is eight moments after the attacks, we have not received any assistance from the government.
“ My present situation has forced me to move out of the accommodation to a cheaper place.
“ Friends have been calling on phone but nobody has given me any assistance,“ he said.
Ndudi appealed to the Federal Government to implement the report on the attack and assist Nigerians who suffered losses.
“ We also appeal to organisations and well meaning Nigerians to assist us restart our businesses. Life has not been easy for us,“ he said.
