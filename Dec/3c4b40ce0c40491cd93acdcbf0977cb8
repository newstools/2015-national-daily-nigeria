A 78 year-old woman, Mrs. Mabel Abiante, has been kidnapped by heavily-armed gunmen at her residence in Ngo, the headquarters of Andoni Local Government Area of Rivers State.
Mrs. Abiante was kidnapped at about 8.50pm last Saturday while watching television in her sitting room. She had closed from her shop at about 8.30pm.
Eyewitnesses narrated that the gunmen, numbering about 15, shot sporadically having positioned some of their men around the house while others moved into the sitting room where they whisked Mrs. Abiante away.
The gun men were, however, challenged by one of Mrs. Abianteâ€™s daughters who was home when they struck. But her efforts did nothing to stop the gunmen used the butts of their gun on her head and right hand leaving her with swollen body..
The kidnappers made their escape through a side of the Ngo River close to the Abiante family house.
They were yet to make contacts with the family as at the time of this report.
