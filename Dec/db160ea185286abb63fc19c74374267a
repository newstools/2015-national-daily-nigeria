Veteran coach Kadiri Ikhana has said he was not shocked his contract at Enyimba was not renewed even after he guided them to a seventh Nigeria league championship because “some of the bosses hated my face”.
“I expected that my contract will not be extended because some of my bosses didn’t like my face,” said Ikhana, who in his first spell at the Aba club to win a first-ever CAF Champions League in 2003.
Enyimba won the league title in November with 70 points from 38 matches.
Enyimba are expected to soon name a replacement for Ikhana with Warri Wolves coach Paul Aigbogun and the Bulgarian Mitko Dobrev formerly of IfeanyiUbah front runners for the top post.
