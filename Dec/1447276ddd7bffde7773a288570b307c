The National Association of Stevedoring Companies (NASC) has kicked against the decision by the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) to lay off 5,000 tally clerks and onboard security men.
The President of the association, Mr. Bolaji Sunmola, gave the indication in an interviewwith newsmen in Lagos.
Sunmola said the matter would be taken to the Federal Ministry of Transport for resolution, adding that the NPA was ready to throw thousands of workers into the labour market alongside their employers.
NPA had indicated at a stakeholders’ meeting on Nov. 10 in Lagos that it would disengage tally clerks and onboard security men by Dec. 15.
In a letter dated Nov. 23, the NPA notified 10 stevedoring firms of its decision to disengage the tally clerks and onboard security men.
The letter was signed by NPA’s Executive Director, Marine and Operations, Mr David Omonibeke.
NPA explained that sequel to the stakeholders meeting on Nov. 10, management had resolved to discontinue with the services of tally clerks and onboard security men.
It noted that this was based on the fact that the authority had ceded cargo handling to terminal operators in the concession areas.
The 10 stevedoring firms are currently engaged in Lagos, Tin Can Island, Onne, Rivers and Calabar ports.
They are Matral Marine Services, Bashisa Global Ltd., Westland International, Dockworth Services International and Long Shore Stevedoring (all in Lagos Port Complex).
Others are Excellent Dominion, Blue Ocean Cargo Handling (Tin-Can port; Patrade Nigeria Ltd. (Rivers port); Insight Marine Ltd. (Onne port) and Fairdeal Agency Ltd. (Calabar port).
