……expresses confidence in Police

From Odimmegwa Johnpeter, Abuja

The Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, NSCIA, has met with the Inspector-General of Police, IGP, Solomon E. Arase, to urge him to look into the clash between the military and the Shiite group in Zaria recently before it degenerates into another insurgency in the country.
NSCIA delegation led by the Secretary-General, Professor Ishaq Oloyede paid a courtesy visit on the IGP in his office at Force Headquarters, Abuja.
In his address, he lauded the leadership qualities of IGP Solomon Arase and the Force Management Team while thanking police for the cooperation extended to the Islamic body on issues bordering on maintaining peace in Islamic matters.
Prof. Oloyede specifically urged the IGP to to look into the immediate and remote causes of the recent clash between the Shiite Islamic group and the armed forces in Zaria such that there will be no repeat of the Boko Haram situation now ravaging the country’s north east.
The body equally appealed for possible medical assistance to those detained in connection with the incident.
In his response, IGP Arase appreciated the delegation’s visit to his office. He emphasized that the Police and other security agencies are conscious of Nigerian citizens’ fundamental rights and would protect them. He also assured them of professional investigation of the incident.  He appealed to the Islamic body to use its reputable and respected platform to caution all groups in the country, that while they have the constitutional rights to express their views, it should not circumscribe the rights of others.
The IGP refuted reports that access to the Shiite leaders in detention was restricted, declaring that their friends, lawyers and even human rights groups have unrestricted access to them under the law.
The IGP, however, reassured of the commitment of the Force to the protection of lives and property and adherence to the tenet of fundamental human rights.
