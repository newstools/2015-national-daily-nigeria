The Lagos State University (LASU) has reversed the increased acceptance fee for the newly admitted students from N20,000 to N10,000.
Mr. Adeyemi Onikoro, President, Lagos State University Students Union (LASUSU)‎, confirmed development to newsmen on Wednesday in Lagos.
Onikoro‎ said that the university’s authority had updated the website for the new students to pay N10, 000 as against N20, 000.
“From our investigation, the new students ‎have started paying the N10, 000 as revised,’’ he said.
LASU ‎authorities had in November increased the acceptance fee for the newly admitted students from N10, 000 to N20, 000 and indigeneship fee from N1,000 to N5, 000.
However, LASUSU had demanded a ‎reversal of the fee with immediate effect to prevent students’ unrest. ‎
Onikoro said while the acceptance fee was reverted, the indigeneship fee had yet to be reversed from N5, 000, to N1, 000.
He said the students union was still negotiating with the university management on the reversal of the indigeneship fee to prevent uprising from the Lagos State ‎indigenes.
“The implication of a refusal by the management ‎not to reverse the indigeneship fee, is that the Lagos State indigenes will be paying more than the non-indigenes in their state owned university,’’ he said.
According to Onikoro, the indigeneship fee‎ must also be reversed so that it will not escalate into community rancour.
“This is not an issue affecting only the students union alone but the National Association of Lagos Indigenes Students (NALIS) and ‎the Lagos State traditional rulers will also seek redress,’’ he said.
Onikoro lauded the management’s effort to reverse the acceptance fee, and urged it to do the needful by reversing the indigeneship fee also.
