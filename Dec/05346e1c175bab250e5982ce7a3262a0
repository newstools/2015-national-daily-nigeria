In a renewed effort to ensure a country-wide availability of petroleum products for the yuletide season, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation, NNPC, has said it is going to expand supply of petrol to the hinterlands using facilities of oil majors and depot.
In a statement released by the Group, and signed by its Group General Manager, Public Affairs, Ohi Alegbe, NNPC said the special supply intervention entails the ramping up of additional supply via massive truck-out to guarantee product penetration to the nooks and crannies of the country. “The daily fuel truck out to locations such as Abuja, Kaduna, Enugu, Ibadan and Jos have also been increased significantly to enhance free flow of the products” the statement said.
It stated that it would in this regard consolidate on its strategic alliance with some major depot owners and oil marketers with strong regional logistics outlay in those areas to ensure maximum infiltration of products especially in the hinterland.
NNPC called on members of the public to refrain from hoarding, product diversion and panic buying of petrol, adding that the intervention measure would help circumvent the challenges posed by the unavailability of pipelines for the transportation of petroleum products.
This new drive, according to the NNPC is aimed at meeting up with a new directive by the minister of State for Petroleum Resources and its Group Managing Director, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu that the Pipelines and Products Marketing Company, PPMC, and Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency, PPPRA must ensure that the products are adequately circulated in the country.
