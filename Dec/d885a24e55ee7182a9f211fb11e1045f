New British light-middleweight boxing champion Liam Williams will not be rushed into a world title fight, says trainer Gary Lockett.
The 23-year-old added the British belt to his Commonwealth title on Saturday by beating Kris Carslaw in two rounds.
Williams was fighting for the first time in 13 months after overcoming a career-threatening hand injury.
“Let’s be realistic. Liam’s had 14 fights and has not been passed eight rounds,” said Lockett.
“That’s testament to the power he’s got in his hands, but I’d like to see him going into the later rounds once or twice.”
Welshman Williams produced a stunning display to win the British belt in Manchester, knocking Scotland’s Carslaw unconscious after only six seconds of round two with a left jab to the temple.
“I was always confident he was going to win, but I didn’t think it would be as early as that,” added Lockett, a former WBU middleweight champion.
“It was a remarkable shot to finish it, which showed Liam’s timing and judgement of distance.”
