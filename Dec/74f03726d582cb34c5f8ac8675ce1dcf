AFE Babalola University Ado-Ekiti (ABUAD) is brimming with life as new sports edifices now adorning the expansive landscape of the private University.
The high institution located in the capital of Ekiti State are the hosts of the 6th edition of the Nigerian Private University Games Association (NPUGA) which began on December 10 and will run till the 20th.
Several students of the University in chats with NATIONAL DAILY Sports praised the ingenuity of the founder, Afe Babalola, describing him as a magician. “Two months ago, these new sports facilities including a new basketball court to complement the only one we had as well as four new tennis courts like the sitting terrace for football and athletics were not here.”
Eager athletes will compete in ten sports including volleyball, basketball, athletics, football, swimming, table tennis , chess, athletics, scrabble,and tennis at the event.
An elated Akintunde Akinola, who doubles as the president of the association and director of sports at Achievers University, Owo, Ondo State, said: “I am so impressed with the quality of development that Aare Babalola and the University management have put together. This is outstanding. They are adequately prepared by what is on ground compared to what was on ground when last we visited.
“This year’s edition has been more competitive going by the interest from other new universities and the state of the art facilities on ground when compared with the last edition held at Joseph Ayo Babalola University (JABU) in December 2013.”
“ABUAD management promised to provide state of the arts facilities of international standard for the games and that is what they have done. One needs to see the pitches to appreciate what I am saying. The management promised they won’t disappoint and that is what exactly they have done,” he observed.
