The President, Maize Growers and Processing Association of Nigeria (MGAPAN), Mr Edwin Uche, has disclosed that the group is determined to boost maize value chain in the country in Port Harcourt on Wednesday.
Uche who said that mechanised maize farming had a large value chain ranging from planting, harvesting, processing, packaging to distribution, stressed that if properly harnessed, maize cultivation could generate more than 20 per cent of jobs for the Nigerian youth.
He reiterated that the group is determined to build capacities for our local farmers in line with world best practices, to enlighten them on the use of improved maize varieties that would give them real value for their money. He also added that the association will also build its members capacities on the right type of seeds and how to access these seeds and agro inputs to adopt in maize cultivation to enhance yield.
“In terms of fertiliser, pesticides and other agro related chemicals to check rodents and pest invasions, we shall also partner relevant bodies to enable farmers to access them at affordable costs,” he said.
Uche who pointed out that one of the greatest challenges to maize production was the lack of sales points, reaffirmed that the association will partner foreign and local companies that use maize as raw material to sell their produce.He said about 80 per cent of infant nutrition, livestock feeds and a large number of other foreign and local dietary foods were maize extracts.
The president noted that if a foreign maize market was created, maize farmers could channel their entire resources to maize cultivation because the crop could be grown and harvested up to three times in a year. “We have plans to collaborate with the federal and state governments to create both foreign and local off-taker markets, we believe with the available off-takers (buyers), our farmers will have good value for their money,” Uche said.
Uche urged the Federal Government to engage CBN to support mechanised maize farming as part of its economic diversification policies in the 2016 farming season, as he promised that its members will cultivate without fear of possible loss due to poor storage facilities knowing that whatever quantity produced as long as it is of good quality, there is a ready market for their produce.
