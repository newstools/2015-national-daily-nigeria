“It shows that democracy has come of age in Africa. All over, you can see the demonstration of peaceful elections, peaceful transitions from one government to another”, the Vice President said.
According to the release, Osinbajo, who represented President Muhammadu Buhari at the ceremony attended by several African presidents and leaders, noted that peaceful elections were producing right leaders on the continent.
