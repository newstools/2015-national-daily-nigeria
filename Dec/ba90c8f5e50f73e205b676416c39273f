The Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority (NCAA) has appealed to domestic airlines to liquidate all outstanding debts to the authority and other aviation agencies in the country.
The NCAA made the appeal in a statement issued by its Acting General Manager, Public Relations, Mr Sam Adurogboye, on Sunday in Lagos.
“Safety is a collective responsibility and we appreciate the cooperation from all stakeholders, particularly the airlines, toward safe operations in the outgoing year.
“The authority has, however, noticed with serious concern, the huge debts of airlines as a result of failure to promptly settle invoices as at when due.
“This poses serious financial challenges to the various Parastatals that benefit from the five per cent Ticket, Charter and Cargo Sales charges.
“Consequently, the authority would be pleased to see that the Airlines put plans in place to ensure the full liquidation of all outstanding debts.
“We thank God for a safe operation in the outgoing year and we look forward to safe and secure operations in the coming years,’’ the NCAA said.
According to the statement, the settlement of the debts will go a long way in assisting NCAA to fulfill its statutory obligations to the country.
It added that the authority was fully committed to strict enforcement of compliance to safety regulations in order to engender safe operations at all times.
