The residents of Calabar have cashed in on the final day of Carnival Calabar to make brisk businesses, the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports.
National Daily survey in parts of the city shows that residents have converted all available spaces along the Carnival routes to business arena displaying various items.
Canopies and chairs were also set up by individuals and groups on the streets along the carnival routes where tourists and fun seekers pay a token to relax and watch the events.
Mr Sunday Akpan told National Daily that he set up his business as early as 7 a.m., adding that people had been patronising him since then not minding that it was still early in the day.
Sunday, who came all the way from Akwa Ibom, said he had been participating in the Carnival Calabar since 2013, adding that he had made some good sales.
“I cannot tell you how much I have made this morning but I have made good money, especially from dry gin and cigarettes,’’ he said.
A food vendor, Mrs Uloma Ezike, said that she came out as early as 6 a.m. with her food and had been selling since then.
“I am about to go and cook another one because this one has almost finished. Normally on a carnival day, I cook three or four times because the food must be hot all the time.
“I have so many customers who used to come to eat. Some buy take-away and others eat here,’’ she said.
A tourist from Edo, Mr Nelson Ighodalo, told National Daily that he was enjoying everything about the carnival.
“Honestly I am enjoying the whole thing, especially looking at the setting; people moving around enjoying themselves; relaxing, dining and wining in the open this early.
“In fact everything here is fun,’’ he said.
National Daily reports that there were presence of security personnel and other para-military at strategic locations along the routes getting ready to maintain law and order as well as ensure orderliness by the crowd.
