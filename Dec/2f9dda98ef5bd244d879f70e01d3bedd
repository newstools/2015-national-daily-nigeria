The Rivers chapter of Independent Petroleum Marketers Association (IPMAN) on Wednesday commended the Federal Government for reducing the pump price of petrol.
The Chairman of the association in the state, Mr Sunny Nkpe, told reporter in Port Harcourt that the `s decision was a welcome development.
He said the association was willing and determined to cooperate and implement the new price regime.
“ For us at IPMAN, whatever intervention or price adjustment by government is a welcome development, as long as the product is made available.
“The situation in Port Harcourt is not too stable because most of the private depots have not received products and we all rely on NNPC ,which is inadequate to take care of consumers’ needs here,“ he said.
Nkpe said the association would cooperate and assist the government to ensure that products were available in the state.
He said all the stakeholders in the sector should also assist the government to ensure that there was availability of products in the country.
