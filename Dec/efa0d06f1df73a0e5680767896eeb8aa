The Director General, National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM), Malam Yusuf Usman, has urged private investors to establish more museums to enhance history.
Usman made the appeal in an interview with the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Lagos on Tuesday and said the commission would provide technical and professional support for interested investors.
The director-general said that the commission was not planning to establish more museums but to consolidate on the existing ones.
“The commission is ready to assist interested investors who would love to build museums.
“This is important because when museums are located closely, everyone will have easy access to them to learn about the past.
“We do not have plans to build more museums as there are museums across the states but we are interested in assisting private individuals who wish to establish more.
“We need to consolidate on the museums on ground,” he said.
