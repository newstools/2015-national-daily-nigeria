To enhance safety standards and policies in the country’s aviation industry, the Association of Foreign Airlines Representatives in Nigeria AFRAN is to collaborate with stakeholders in the country.
Exchanging views with aviation correspondents in his office at the Murtala Muhammed Airport Ikeja, on the 3rd Safety Summit, the president of AFARN, Mr Kingsley Nwokoma, said the need to foster improved global operating standards in the country cannot be over emphasised.
Nwokoma explained that since safety formed the bedrock of aviation there was need for stakeholders to collaborate in view of recent security development in the world in order to maintain safer skies.
“Aviation is something that everybody should come together to grow it and we will all be proud of it. There are so many units that make up the industry and collaboration is the key to move the industry forward, we want performance but we must drive safety with it ”
According to Nwokoma, various issues in the aviation sector, such as safe skies, airport reforms among others have been slated for discuss at this years safety summit with its theme, ‘collaboration for sustainable aviation in Nigeria, through safety to performance.’
Nwokoma decried the poor state of Port Harcourt International Airport since it attracted world wide condemnation “If MMIA and PHIA are in this way, what will be of all the other airports in the country. Port Harcourt is crazy because it’s a tent. That means there is a problem.”
He called on the government to address the challenges facing the aviation sector in the country in order to improve the standard of the sector.
