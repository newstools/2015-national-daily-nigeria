Father of Nigerian youth international, Victor Osimhen, Patrick Osimhen, is reportedly at war with the owner of 36 Lions, Olawale Gafar, after a disagreement over the transfer of the Golden Eaglets star to German side VFL Wolfsburg.
Gafar allegedly sent thugs to beat up Patrick Osimhen and was thoroughly beaten till he suffered a broken arm before he was hurriedly rushed to an hospital, where he was admitted.
Speaking on the feud, Patrick Osimhen dispelled widespread reports that Gafar was his son’s legal guardian and adviser as he referred to the 36 Lions owner as an impostor adding that only Shira Yussuf, his partner Ariyo Igbayilola and Ultimate Strikers coach Chinedu Ogbenna have been authorized to represent Victor Osimhen.
In his words, he said: “Gafar, I don’t care to see him and I don’t want to see him. I only know Ariyo, Shira and Chinedu, I don’t know who Gafar is.”
Llameed Olawale Gafar, a native of Porto Novo, Benin Republic, and reportedly backed by NFF President Amaju Pinnick and Vice President Barrister Seyi Akinwunmi, owns 10% of Victor Osimhen’s economic rights having bought it for $24,000 (about N6m) in what is a third-party ownership prohibited by FIFA.
