It stated, “The development reflected, wholly, the rise in investment in treasury securities by the banking system, particularly Nigerian Treasury Bills, which grew by 10.4 per cent.
“Persistent increase in credit to government deprives the private sector of needed credit to boost economic growth.” The report added that consumer credit fell by 9.6 per cent to N768.67bn at the end of June below the level at the end of second half of 2014.
