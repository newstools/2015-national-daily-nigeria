Arik Air has suffered another passenger loss on board its flight again as a 57 year old man, Albert  Nnadi was found dead on board a Lagos–Owerri flight.
The passenger was said to have been found at the point when passengers were disembarking the flight at the Murtala Muhammed Domestic Airport  Terminal One, Lagos.
The passenger, who was accompanied by one of  his relatives identified as Damien Nwachkwu,  was said to  be  on the ill fated trip to Lagos to  seek medical assistance on obesity.
National Daily gathered that  the corpse  was rejected at the morgue of Lagos State University Teaching Hospital(LASUTH) because it was too large for any of the compartments. It was later transferred to Lagos General Hospital.
Arik has been in the news in recent times over reported cases of deaths, luggage theft, stowaway, drug pushing and infringement on rights of passengers.
The airline is also known for flight delays and cancellations without due compensation to passengers.
