Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the General Overseer, Redeemed Christian Church of God, (RCCG) has urged Christians to remain resolute in their service to God, in spite the challenges experienced in the country.
He gave the advice in a telecast to congregation at the 2015 Holy Ghost Congress, tagged: “Floodgates of Heaven”, an annual event of the church at the Redemption Camp, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway on Saturday.
He encouraged the Christians not to despair, saying that the challenges would ‘’soon be over”.
The religious leader, who made reference to the Book of second Kings, Chapter 7, verse one to 11, noted that it was not God’s will for Christians to experience stagnation in life.
He described stagnation as a setback in man’s life which should not be allowed to thrive, saying that stagnation could be caused by the mindset of an individual.
“Stagnation could also be caused by forces beyond a person’s control, ” he said.
The general overseer, however, said that “when God opens the windows of Heaven,’ stagnation will be put to an end and progress will become evident in the life of the believers.’’
“With the windows of Heaven open, destitution will give way to abundance and abundance is not just having billions; rather it is having more than you need.
“The hopeless will begin to sing new songs of victory as a result of a turnaround in the scheme of things.”
Adeboye identified Sarah and Martha in the Bible as examples of people who rejoiced with songs of victory as a result of God’s miracles in their life.
Many dignitaries including the Vice-President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo and his wife, Dolapo, Mr Akinwumi Ambode, Lagos State Governor and his counterpart in Ondo State, Dr Olusegun Mimiko also attended the programme.
