The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) has deployed about 200 truckloads of fuel to Abuja to help reduce the ongoing fuel scarcity and ease Yuletide celebration.
This is contained in a statement signed by Mr. Ohi Alegbe, Group General Manager, Group Public Affairs Division, on Monday in Abuja.
“In continuation of the special intervention fuel supply for the Yuletide season, another 567 trucks have been dispatched nationwide today,” it said.
It further stated that the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources, Dr. Ibe Kachikwu, had directed the deployment of NNPC staff to filling stations across the country for effective monitoring of the distribution system.
This, it said, was to ensure the total eradication of queues from fuel stations across the country.
The statement said the minister, at an emergency meeting with senior staff of the corporation, said there were a number of challenges in the supply and distribution system that hampered efficient distribution of products.
According to him, it is time for NNPC to rise above the challenges by ensuring that the special intervention supplies are not diverted or hoarded.
