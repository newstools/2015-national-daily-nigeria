In his continued efforts to ensure that there is peace and tranquility in the country, the Inspector General of Police, Solomon Arase has warned Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) against plans to engage in violent protest using offensive weapons across some South Eastern states.
He further reminded the planners of the protest to be mindful of the fact that the law prohibiting the unlawful possession of firearms is still in-force noting that the force will not hesitate to use the apparatus of the law against such security threat to the nation.
In a statement in Abuja by the Force Public Relations Officer, ACP Kolawole Adebisi said, “Any attempt to unleash mayhem on innocent and law abiding Nigerians under any guise by this group will be met with stiff resistance from the Police and other security agencies, and the actors will be brought to justice in line with extant criminal laws.
“Citizens in the South-Eastern States are hereby assured of adequate protection, as appropriate Police deployment has been emplaced to deal decisively with any group or persons who might be bent on breaching public peace and threatening national security,” the statement added.
Following agitations by the Igbos to secede under the umbrella of Republic of Biafra and subsequently the arrest on October 17 of the Director of Biafra Radio, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, by the Department of State Services (DSS), there has been protest with a view to securing his release.
The Biafra Radio Director, who is also the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) was arrested in Lagos when he flew into the country from the United Kingdom.
