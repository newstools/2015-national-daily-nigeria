The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), on Tuesday in Lagos said the agency arrested over 2,000 suspected drug peddlers in 11 months.
The Director-General, Mrs Roli Bode-George, made the disclosure while speaking with journalists at the ongoing 50th celebration of the Naval Officers’ Wives Association (NOWA) at Apapa.
She said that after arresting the drug end users, the agency also rehabilitates them in NDLEA rehabilitation centres in each state.
“On a daily basis, in some commands in the federation, we arrest nothing less than 300 but not in one place,” she said.
Bode-George, who delivered the anniversary lecture on “Drug Abuse and Addiction”, urged women to always monitor their children to avert usage of illicit drugs by them.
“Let us look out for our kids, do not be busy to care for them because drugs are not the way to go,” she said.
The National President of NOWA, Mrs Theresa Ibas, said that she was delighted to have the NDLEA boss to enlighten the women about drug use and its adverse effect on human body system.
“NOWA takes cognizance of the prevailing situation of things in the country, particularly drug abuse among our youths. This is why we invited the NDLEA to address the issues and views on drug abuse,” she said.
In attendance were the Flag Officer Commanding, Western Naval Command, Rear Admiral Ralph Osondu. Students of NOWA schools, other senior officers and  members of the association
