The Civil Aviation Policy would be reviewed in order to accommodate the planned policies of this government which would include a Master Plan to reform institutions, airports (domestic and international hubs) and national airlines, to provide domestic and international services, said the new Minister of States on Aviation, Hadi Sirika.
Sirika stated this during the  ICAO 2015 World  Aviation Forum holding in Montreal, Canada, 23 – 25 November 2015.
According to the Minister, “Nigeria, under the leadership of President Muhammadu Buhari, will continue to upgrade and develop aviation infrastructure to improve aviation safety and security, thus creating an enabling environment for growth of airlines and other service providers, as well as protecting the interest of aviation end-users.”
In a keynote address, the ICAO President, Dr Olumuyiwa Bernard Aliu, said it was a key goal for the  organization to assist member States to the fullest extent,  possible with respect to the implementation of ICAO standards and policies.
