NIGERIA Governors Forum (NGF) has commended the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) for the N1.04 trillion fine (some $5.2 billion) imposed on MTN, Nigeria’s leading Telecommunication Company.
The NGF also tasked the Federal Government to ensure MTN pays the fine in full and promptly.
NCC sanctioned the service provider for failing to meet a deadline to disconnect 5.2 million unregistered subscribers earlier this year.
At the end of their meeting, the 36 states governors commended the NCC for its strict enforcement of the law in its regulation of the telecom sector, and encouraged the commission to go ahead with its strict regulatory duties without any fear or favour.
They also insisted that that MTN must pay up in full.
Governor AbdulazeezYari, chairman of the Forum, told newsmen that the governors after receiving a presentation from the NCC chairman congratulated him on his appointment and assured to collaborate with the commission to assist in boosting the telecommunication industry.
“The Forum also commended the NCC for its strict compliance and enforcement of the law with regards to the fine issued to MTN and advised the Federal Government to ensure prompt and full payment,” he said
