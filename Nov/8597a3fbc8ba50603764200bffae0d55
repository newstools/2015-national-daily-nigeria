The Director of the group, Mr. Umoh Johnson said having received information on, the spill a team was dispatched to the affected community to ascertain the development.

He said NACGOND as a matter of urgency would engage ExxonMobil and other oil companies operating within the area on advocacy visit to reduce the record of oil spills in the community. However, the response team of ExxonMobil was said to have had confrontation with a group of angry youths from the community at the Nkanafang Park by Ibeno Beach on their way back.
