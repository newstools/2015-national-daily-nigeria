• PTML, Ecomarine, others withdraw membership 
THE crisis rocking Seaport Terminal Operators of Nigeria (STOAN) has reached another dimension as some members left the association for alleged high handedness and the confrontational attitude of the leadership of the association against government policies.
Findings have revealed that some terminal operators such as the Greenview Development Nigeria Limited; Ports and Terminal Multiservices Ltd; Ecomarine Limited; Intels Limited have left STOAN.
Some other members who are still in the association have stopped both financial and non-financial contributions to the association and could only be regarded as passive members
Members under the passive status are: Julius Berger Nigeria Services, Warri; Port and Terminal Operators Limited(PTOL); Brawal Oil Services Limited; Gulftainer Bell Limited/Greenleigh Limited, Koko Port; Bua Ports and Terminals Limited; Josepdam Nigeria Limited; Five Star Logistics Limited and Ports and Cargo Handling Company Limited.
A member of the association who craved anonymity revealed that some of the terminal operators who have opted out of STOAN are not pleased with the leadership’s confrontational approach against the government and economic regulations.
Moreover, while some have equally alleged that STOAN is about Lagos based terminal operators, even as other said that it has been hijacked by APMT and Princess Vicky Haastrup, the chairman.
Speaking recently, a terminal operator in Port Harcourt recently criticised the leadership style of Haastrup. His words, “We have a problem among members. Is Intels not terminal operator, and a supposed member of STOAN, yet we are in court contesting monopoly in oil and gas related cargo? What has STOAN done to resolve that? In Calabar port, the problem of channel dredging has been on for years, how many times has STOAN come up to speak about it.
