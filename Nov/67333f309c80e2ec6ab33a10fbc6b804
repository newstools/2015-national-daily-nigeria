The President of the Senate, Dr. Bukola Abubakar Saraki, has suffered another setback in his efforts to stop his trial at the Code of Conduct Tribunal (CCT). A Federal High Court in Lagos presided over by Justice Ibrahim Baba has dismissed an application by Senate President seeking an injunction against his prosecution at the Code of Conduct Tribunal in Abuja by the Code of Conduct Bureau.
Justice Baba in his ruling, this Friday, said that his court lacks jurisdiction on the matter.
Saraki is being tried at the CCT over allegations of improper declaration of his assets.
At the resumed session on Thursday, Saraki was abandoned by his lawyers who walked out on the CCT Chairman on the accusation of “judicial rascality”, when they failed to prevail on the Chairman to suspend hearing pending the determination of the suit at the Supreme Court. The Court of Appeal had earlier dismissed Saraki’s appeal on the suit seeking injunction to stop the CCT from his trial on charges of false declaration of assets. The case was then adjourned to November 19 when on the substantive suit is expected to commence.
