The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State Command, CP Fatai Owoseni has been put on the radar as fraudsters have opened several Facebook accounts with his names and picture with a view to defrauding gullible Nigerians.
The Commissioner in a reaction said that he has never opened any Facebook account not to talk of having one and appealed to members of the public to shun such accounts as they were not opened by him.
In a statement by the Lagos State Police spokesperson, DSP Joe Offor in Lagos said, “The attention of the Lagos State Commissioner of police has drawn to several Facebook Accounts in the name of CP Fatai Owoseni created by certain Fraudsters, ostensibly to deceive and/or defraud the unsuspecting members of the public.
The Commissioner of Police wishes to use this medium to inform the members of the public that he does not have any Facebook Accounts and as such, denied the ownership of the said Facebook Accounts.
“Furthermore, the members of the public are reminded that the CP does not operate any social media platform and members of the public are advised in their own best interest not to have any dealings with the Fraudsters masquerading in the name of CP Fatai Owoseni, while effort is underway to unravel those behind this scam,” DSP Offor stated.
