SUPER Eagles midfielder Ogenyi Onazi has pleaded with Nigerians to be patient with the team as they seek to berth at the 2018 World Cup in Russia.
The team were held to a barren by Swaziland last Friday prompting angry reactions from Nigerians over the dismal performance of the players.
“Nigerians need to understand that this a young team that is still trying to find a rhythm. The potentials are there and the players are not going to become the best overnight,” he said.
“The fans need to support the team all the way. It doesn’t matter if we are playing well or not. It is also the desire of the players to be at their best and I can assure we are all working very hard at that.”
“The condition in Switzerland was not good and we struggled for most part of the game but we could have won. We contained the opponents and created the best chances of the game but unfortunately, we were not clinical enough.”
There will be a lot of positives in the return leg in Port Harcourt on Tuesday, Onazi who plays in the Seria A for Lazio promised.
