“I enjoy music even without being paid for”.

He urged the Federal government to imbibe Talent hunt discovery, this according to him “will encourage creativity among the youth, which in turn promote self employment”. He suggested that Talent hunt method will enable, the government to know the area where youth could be assisted on job creation.  He explained that Nigeria Youth are gifted in various ways, “if government embarked on Talent discovery method and give necessary assistance ,youth would be opportuned to show case their talent and put it into practice for self employment without relying on white collar job”.
