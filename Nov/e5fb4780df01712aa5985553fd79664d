…As NAFDAC fines Guinness N1bn for infractions
NIGERIA’S image has further gotten a boost as the International Bar Association (IBA) appoints a maritime lawyer and revered Senior Advocate of Nigeria (SAN), Mike Igbokwe as IBA’s Regional Representative for Africa.
The appointment is for a two-year term starting from 2016; implying that by virtue of the appointment, Barrister Igbokwe would become one of the Committee’s Officers from 2016
The announcement was made by a Committee’s Chairman, Mr. Ricardo Rozas, at the Aux Gazalles, Vienna, in ratification of decision by the Maritime and Transport Law Committee, which is one of the Committees under the Maritime and Aviation Section of the Legal Practice Division of the IBA.
Industry watchers who spoke on conditions of anonymity lauded the appointment, noting Igbokwe’s total commitment to the legal profession, within and outside Nigeria.
The Senior Advocate however took the announcement with genuine humility.
“I believe the appointment is in recognition of my humble contribution to the development of the maritime law work of the Committee in particular and IBA in general and it is a honour done to Nigeria and Africa as a whole which I intend to uphold and use to promote the ideals and aims of the Committee and IBA in Nigeria and Africa”, Igbokwe indicated.
Noted on the IBA’s website: ‘through the various committees of the divisions, the IBA enables an interchange of information and views among its members as to laws, practices and professional responsibilities relating to the practice of business law around the globe.’
The Committee organizes ‘specialist conferences yearly where members connect to discuss the latest issues within their field as well as making international contacts’. It also publishes regular news and articles for its members and may undertake various projects of relevance to its practice area.
