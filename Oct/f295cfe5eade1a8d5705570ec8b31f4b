The Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) has fined MTN Nigeria the sum of N1.4 trillion over alleged breach of SIM registration rules.
MTN Nigeria, which has the largest subscriber base in the country, is owned by South Africaâ€™s MTN Group.
According to technology Times which broke the story, citing people conversant with the development at the NCC headquarters in Abuja, MTN is accused of allegedly undermining efforts by the Nigerian government to tackle security challenges and the war on terror as well as allied crimes, following its alleged refusal to comply with a directive to deactivate unregistered mobile phone lines on its network.
It was gathered that MTN confirmed that the mobile phone company has received a letter from the regulator confirming the fine.
Nigeria is presently facing serious security threats from the Boko Haram, a terrorists group with mostly operations in northern Nigeria, and kidnappers who most make ransom demands using anonymous cell phones.
