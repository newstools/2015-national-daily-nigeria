An explosion has rocked Oworonshoki, a Lagos suburb injuring five persons including a baby.
It happened at a closed beer parlour which was yet to open for business today at
L & k Street, Oworonsoki, inward Mayaki, Lagos
State.
Immediately the explosion went off, there was pandemonium as words spread that the explosion killed five people in the building housing beer parlour.
The police anti-bomb squad and the National Emergency
Management Agency has taken over the Epi-centre even though the crowd that besieged the place is hampering recovery effort.
However, the cause of the explosion is unknown but the security agencies including NEMA and fire service are unravelling the cause of the explosion.
At the moment, all the injured persons have been taken nearby Afolabi hospital were they are being treated.
Confirming the explosion, the South West Coordinator, National Emergency
Management Agency , Mr. Ibrahim Farinloye, said there was an explosion inside a
locked beer parlour that is yet to open today.
He revealed that four people including a girl were injured
and had been rushed to Afolabi Hospital for
treatment.
“Fire service and police are trying to find out the
cause of the explosion as the shop was locked at the time of explosion. Crowd are greatly impeding emergency works.
It is, however, difficult to say whether the explosion has any connection with Boko Haram insurgents as some elements are said to have sneaked into other parts of the country following massive bombardment of their “evil” camps in the north east.
On Saturday in Lagos, the Chief of Army Staff, Lt Gen Tukur Yusuf Buratai had said at the Ikeja cantonment while addressing soldiers and officers that some Boko Haram elements have sneaked into other parts of the country calling for vigilance.
Buratai added that the force was tracing them for arrest.
