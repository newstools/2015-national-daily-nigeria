…completes airlift operation
MEDVIEW Airline has commiserated with the families of pilgrims who lost their lives in the stampede in Saudi Arabia during the 2015 Hajj.
In a message to the families, National Hajj Commission of Nigeria (NAHCON) and states governments, the airline’s Managing Director/CEO, Alhaji Muneer Bankole, prayed to God to give them the fortitude to bear the irreparable loss.
He said no one can question the will of God, who created the human race, saying “only God knows why such a calamity should occur at that time.”
Alhaji Bankole, who spoke when the last batch of pilgrims was flown home yesterday, confirmed that the airline has completed the 2015 Hajj airlift. The aircraft marked “Abeke” with 221 pilgrims arrived the Murtala Muhammed Airport, Lagos via Port Harcourt at 12 noon.
The NAHCON contracted MedView airline to airlift pilgrims from states in South-West, South East, South-South zones, Borno State and members of the armed forces.
Medview Airline is the first amongst other carriers to complete the airlift of pilgrims back to Nigeria at a record time.
