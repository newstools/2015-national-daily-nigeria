THE Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority is to meet with trade unions in the aviation sector on October 21 to resolve the lingering dispute over staff promotion.
Olayinka Abioye, the Assistant General Secretary of the National Union of Air Transport Employees, disclosed this in Lagos on Thursday in an interview with aviation correspondents.
Abioye said that NUATE and other unions in the aviation industry had threatened to go on strike if the NCAA refused to promote some of their members.
They had accused the NCAA management of being nonchalant to the promotion of their members, who had been long overdue for promotion.
When contacted, the NCAA, through its spokesperson, Sam Adurogboye, had insisted that the workers would only be promoted after passing a written examination in line with the directive of the Federal Government.
Reacting to the NCAA’s position on the matter, Abioye confirmed that the NCAA has already invited the union leaders for a meeting on October 21 to find an amicable solution to douse the dispute.
According to him, “we also have information that the management has already started issuing out letters for promotion interviews. Unfortunately, what is contained in the letter is still a subject of controversy because the unanimous decision of the workers is that the terms and conditions of service of the NCAA must be followed.”
He said the requirement for promotion involves an interface with the management and those to be interviewed. As such, the unions would not accede to any other procedure in the interest of its members.
