The Nigerian Police have denied harping blames on the Nigerian Navy  and Airforce for not responding to their distress calls when armed robbers attacked two generation banks at FESTAC Town on Tuesday.
The story published in some National Dailies Friday credited to some senior police officers who spoke anonymously alleged that some Police officers blamed the Navy and Airforce for not assisting them with fire power during the Tuesday’s robbery incident at Festac Lagos.
In a statement by the Police Public Relations Officer, Zone 2 Command, Lagos, ACP Lawal Adebowale said “The attention of the Assistant Inspector General of Police in charge Zone 2 Command Lagos has been drawn to the publication in some National Dailies. We wish to state emphatically that there was no iota of truth in this publication.
“It is a fact that the AIG visited the scene accompanied by some senior police officers but he was the only person that granted press interview and he did not at any point in time apportion blame to any security agency(ies).
“As a matter of fact, the AIG appreciates the existing synergy between the Police and other security agencies, this explains why upon assumption of office, he paid courtesy visit on the Heads of the Army, Airforce and Navy to seek for their cooperation and sustainance of the existing concerted collaborative efforts in fighting crime in his command.”
ACP Adebowale further stated that “The AIG appreciates the role of the press in crime fighting however he advises gentlemen of the press to always get their facts right before any publication to avoid causing any friction between the security agencies.
