The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, (EFCC), on Wednesday arraigned Abubakar Ali Peters and his company Nadabo Energy Limited before Justice S.S Ogunsanya of the Lagos State High Court, Ikeja  on 21-count charge bordering on obtaining money under false pretence, diversion of Federal Government funds and forgery.
The accused persons allegedly obtained the sum N761, 628, 993.84 from the Federal Government of Nigeria under the Petroleum Support Fund for the purpose of importing 16, 808, 064 litres of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) but fraudulently imported only 7, 953, 962 litres and diverted the rest of the product and its proceeds for personal use.
Abubakar, 33, is also facing a similar charge brought against him by the EFCC before Justice Balogun of the Lagos State High Court.
In the charges preferred against him, reads, â€œ that, you Nadabo Energy limited on or about 26th day of September 2011 in Lagos within the Ikeja judicial division fraudulently obtained the sum of N761, 628, 993.84 from the Federal Government by falsely representing that the sum represented the subsidy accrued to Nadabo Energy Limited under the Petroleum Support Fund for the importation of   16,808,064 litres of Premium Motor Spirit  (PMS) which Nadabo Energy limited purported to have purchased from Delano Petroleum Corporation Akara Tortola British Virgin Island, and transported the  16, 808, 064 through MT Gotland Carolina (mother vessel) and MT Sonia (daughter vessel) to Nigeria, whereas Nadabo Energy limited only imported 7, 953,962 litres of PMS from Delany Petroleum Corporation Akara Tortola British Virgin Island and transported 7,953,962 litres of PMS through MT Gotland Carolina (mother vessel) and MT Songa (daughter vessel) to Nigeria.
The accused person as well as his company pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Justice Ogunsanya granted bail to the accused persons on the terms earlier offered them by Justice Balogun and adjourned the case to November 12, 2015 for the commencement of trial.
