The Inspector General of Police, Solomon Arase in Abuja on Monday reiterated the subsisting ban on fireworks in the country, saying that anyone caught violating the law will be dealt with according to the provisions of the laws.
He said the warning became crucial as there is plethora of reports that hoodlums are now using fireworks to confuse Nigerians in order to carry out their nefarious activities.
The Force Public Relations Officer, ACP Olabisi Kolawole said in a statement that the IGP said that “It has come to the knowledge of the Nigeria Police Force that some Nigerians have started using fireworks and firecrackers in anticipation of the yuletide celebrations.
“With the present security situation, occasioned by recent bombings in parts of the country, IGP Solomon E. Arase is advising Nigerians to desist from using fireworks, otherwise called “knock out” as the ban on it is still in force. Violators of this warning will be made to face the wrath of the law.”
